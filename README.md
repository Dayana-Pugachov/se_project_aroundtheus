# Project 3: Around The U.S.

"Around The U.S." is the third project in the Software Engineer program at TripleTen. It was created using the newly aquired skills, including grid layout and responsive design techniques. It is the first project I made relying on a Figma design as opposed to the previous projects that were made with reliance on briefs.

## Project Features

- Resposive design
- Grid layout
- Media-queries
- Flat BEM file structure
